# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# brickyard = Venue.create(name: "Brickyard", address: "266 Dauphin St Mobile, AL 36602", hours: "11:05AM - 3:58AM");
# the_merry_widow = Venue.create(name: "The Merry Widow", address: "51 S Conception St Mobile, AL 36602", hours: "11:05AM - 3:58AM");
